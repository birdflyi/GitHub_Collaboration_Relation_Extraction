## Proposed changes

Dev design doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wUNd8U1u-w8T-qQUReplPhDFkETj3AtFr_Shex501ls/edit?usp=sharing


- add config and checker to enable or disable the cube planner1 when build a new segment or refresh a segment. 
- add property of `@JsonProperty(""layout_cost_based_pruned_list"")` which is used to indicate whether the rulebaseindex has been recommended by the cost based algorithm.
- insert a  new stage of `COST_BASED_PLANNER` in `CUBING` job, and the new stage is used to create task to collect the statistics and run the cost based algorithm.
- use the `biginteger` instead of `long` to represent the cuboio
- migrate the algorithm from kylin3.1 to kylin5.0 without major changes, and just make some adaptive changes. For example, change the cubeio from `long` to `biginteger`
- migrate the IT/UT for the recommended algorithm from kylin3.1 to kylin5.0

Dev design doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wUNd8U1u-w8T-qQUReplPhDFkETj3AtFr_Shex501ls/edit?usp=sharing


- add config and checker to enable or disable the cube planner1 when build a new segment or refresh a segment. 
- add property of `@JsonProperty(""layout_cost_based_pruned_list"")` which is used to indicate whether the rulebaseindex has been recommended by the cost based algorithm.
- insert a  new stage of `COST_BASED_PLANNER` in `CUBING` job, and the new stage is used to create task to collect the statistics and run the cost based algorithm.
- use the `biginteger` instead of `long` to represent the cuboio
- migrate the algorithm from kylin3.1 to kylin5.0 without major changes, and just make some adaptive changes. For example, change the cubeio from `long` to `biginteger`
- migrate the IT/UT for the recommended algorithm from kylin3.1 to kylin5.0

No index was built from new created flat table.
For this case, there won't be any data inconsistency across indexes. And there is no need to build a new flat table to serve the stage of index build by layer.

1. Add a new property `kylin.query.pushdown-concurrent-running-threshold=10` to control the concurrency of the queries pushed down, 10 running queries by default, which will be bond to a Semaphore instance in JVM scope.

2. The pushed down query will calling `Semaphore` instance's `tryAcquire(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)` to acquire the chance to run, so the waiting queries could be interrupted if failed in `330s` by default.

## Why these changes?
1. `QueryLimiter` won't working then the server is not in `downgrade` state, which means no limitations on the number of queries pushed down to run, therefore we need another strategy to accomplish the goal.
2. During retrieving the file status, it gives us a chance to react to the interruption, so as to terminate the planning queries.

- add config and checker to enable or disable the cube planner1 when build a new segment or refresh a segment. 
- add property of `@JsonProperty(""layout_cost_based_pruned_list"")` which is used to indicate whether the rulebaseindex has been recommended by the cost based algorithm.
- insert a  new stage of `COST_BASED_PLANNER` in `CUBING` job, and the new stage is used to create task to collect the statistics and run the cost based algorithm.
- use the `biginteger` instead of `long` to represent the cuboio
- migrate the algorithm from kylin3.1 to kylin5.0 without major changes, and just make some adaptive changes. For example, change the cubeio from `long` to `biginteger`
- migrate the IT/UT for the recommended algorithm from kylin3.1 to kylin5.0

## Proposed changes

Dev design doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wUNd8U1u-w8T-qQUReplPhDFkETj3AtFr_Shex501ls/edit?usp=sharing


- add config and checker to enable or disable the cube planner1 when build a new segment or refresh a segment. 
- add property of `@JsonProperty(""layout_cost_based_pruned_list"")` which is used to indicate whether the rulebaseindex has been recommended by the cost based algorithm.
- insert a  new stage of `COST_BASED_PLANNER` in `CUBING` job, and the new stage is used to create task to collect the statistics and run the cost based algorithm.
- use the `biginteger` instead of `long` to represent the cuboio
- migrate the algorithm from kylin3.1 to kylin5.0 without major changes, and just make some adaptive changes. For example, change the cubeio from `long` to `biginteger`
- migrate the IT/UT for the recommended algorithm from kylin3.1 to kylin5.0
